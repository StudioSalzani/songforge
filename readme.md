# Songforge — The Book of Maledictions

Songforge is a constraint-based music composition ritual.

It is designed to force completion, not inspiration.

---

## What this is

Songforge is a web-based ritual that imposes:
- mandatory creative constraints
- a fixed 60-minute session
- a final, non-negotiable export

Each session ends with a session log.
The piece is considered finished.

There are no rerolls.
There is no undo.
There is no iteration inside the ritual.

---

## What this is NOT

Songforge is NOT:
- a random idea generator
- a music theory assistant
- an inspirational tool
- a sandbox
- a productivity hack

If you are looking for comfort or flexibility, this tool will be frustrating.

## How it works (high level)

1. You begin a session.
2. You receive a mandatory structure constraint.
3. You choose between rhythm or texture, then accept a constraint.
4. You receive a mandatory chaos malediction.
5. You work for exactly 60 minutes.
6. You export whatever exists at the end.
7. A session log is generated.

That is all.

Once the session begins, nothing can be changed.

## Philosophy

Songforge is built on one assumption:
Most musicians do not fail because of lack of ideas,
but because of lack of enforced decisions.

Constraints are not here to inspire.
They are here to remove excuses.

## Technical notes

- This project is intentionally simple.
- No backend.
- No account system.
- No analytics visible to the user.
- No personalization of rules.

The constraints and the protocol are the product.

---

## Status

This is an experimental prototype.
Rules are intentionally strict.
They may evolve, but will not soften.
